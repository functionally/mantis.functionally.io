title: How to Generate Cardano Payment and Stake Keys from a Trezor Model T Seed Phrase
---


Here is a recipe for recovering payment and stake keys if a [Trezor Model T](https://trezor.io/) is lost or damaged and a new Trezor Model T is not available. (Note that performing this procedure defeats the purpose of using a hardware wallet, however, since it involves typing seed phrases on a computer.) This procedure also works for seed phrases from [Daedalus wallets](https://daedaluswallet.io/) and perhaps also for those from [Yoroi wallets](https://yoroi-wallet.com/); it does not work with the [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-xu)--see [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/f6ugn3/15_word_wallet_restoration/fi7fue6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for an indication that the mnemonics differ between Ledger and Daedalus; a Haskell program for computing the Ledger Nano X root private key from the seed is [here](ledger-private-key.hs). *Always use best practices (e.g., a well-secured air-gapped computer) for working securely with seed phrases and for generating private/secret key files.*


## Prerequisites

This procedure requires [cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/tree/master/README.md) and [cardano-cli](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/tree/master/cardano-cli/README.md).


## Recovering the root private key.

Enter the 12-word passphrase (Trezor Model T) or 24-word passphrase (Shelley wallet on Daedalus) at the prompt to convert it to the root private key:

	BASENAME=my-credentials
	
	cardano-wallet key from-recovery-phrase Shelley > $BASENAME.root.prv


## Generate payment keys.

Now generate the private key `$BASENAME.payment-0.prv` for the first wallet address, and its corresponding public key `$BASENAME.payment-0.pub`:

	cardano-wallet key child 1852H/1815H/0H/0/0    < $BASENAME.root.prv      > $BASENAME.payment-0.prv
	cardano-wallet key public --without-chain-code < $BASENAME.payment-0.prv > $BASENAME.payment-0.pub

Other payment keys can be generated by incrementing the last number in the derivation path `1852H/1815H/0H/0/0`. The payment keys from Trezor Model T are obtained by incrementing this last digit, but those for Daedalus wallets are obtain from incrementing the last digit of the derivation paths `1852H/1815H/0H/0/0` and `1852H/1815H/0H/1/0`.

These keys can be converted to the format most convenient for `cardano-cli`, using the following commands:

	cardano-cli key convert-cardano-address-key --shelley-payment-key \
	                                            --signing-key-file $BASENAME.payment-0.prv \
	                                            --out-file $BASENAME.payment-0.skey
	cardano-cli key verification-key --signing-key-file $BASENAME.payment-0.skey \
	                                 --verification-key-file $BASENAME.payment-0.vkey

In particular, `$BASENAME.payment-0.skey` can be used for signing transactions with `cardano-cli`: this would allow one to move funds secured by the original wallet.


## Generate the stake key.

The procedure for generating the stake key is similar to that for the payment key:

	cardano-wallet key child 1852H/1815H/0H/2/0    < $BASENAME.root.prv  > $BASENAME.stake.prv
	cardano-wallet key public --without-chain-code < $BASENAME.stake.prv > $BASENAME.stake.pub
	
	cardano-cli key convert-cardano-address-key --shelley-payment-key \
	                                            --signing-key-file $BASENAME.stake.prv \
	                                            --out-file $BASENAME.stake.skey
	cardano-cli key verification-key --signing-key-file $BASENAME.stake.skey \
	                                 --verification-key-file $BASENAME.stake.vkey


## Generate addresses.

The each payment address is computed from the corresponding payment key and from the stake key:

	cardano-cli address build --mainnet \
	                          --payment-verification-key $(cat $BASENAME.payment-0.pub) \
	                          --stake-verification-key $(cat $BASENAME.stake.pub) \
	                          --out-file $BASENAME.payment-0.address

These addresses should match those of the original wallet.


One can also generate the stake address:

	cardano-cli stake-address build --mainnet \
	                                --stake-verification-key-file $BASENAME.stake.pub \
	                                --out-file $BASENAME.stake.address


## Addendum

The [cardano-address tool](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-addresses/blob/master/README.md) performs similar functions to [cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/tree/master/README.md) and [cardano-cli](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/tree/master/cardano-cli/README.md).
